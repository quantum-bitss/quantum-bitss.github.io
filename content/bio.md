I am a master student from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I earned my bachelor degree from [School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs/), [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/), majoring in Computer Science. I was honored to be supervised by Prof. [Li Liu](https://liliu-avril.github.io/) from [AI Thrust](https://ait.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), [HKUST (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) and Prof. [Tong Zhang](http://dsail.vip/TeamMember.html) from [DSAIL](http://www.dsail.vip/), SCUT during my bachelor study. 

My research interest lies on **Trustworthy Machine Learning**. Currently, I focus on the security of **LLM agent**, including **Prompt Injection** and **Backdoor Learning**. I'm also interested in security issues in other domains of AI, including Diffusion Model, Audio and Computer Vision.
