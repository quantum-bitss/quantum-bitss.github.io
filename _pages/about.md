Hi! I'm a final year undergraduate student from [Department of CSE](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs/), [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/), majoring in Computer Science and Technology (Elite Class). I am very fortunate be supervised by [Prof. Li Liu](https://liliu-avril.github.io/) from [AI Thrust](https://ait.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), HKUST (Guangzhou) and [Prof. Tong Zhang](http://dsail.vip/TeamMember.html) from [DSAIL](http://www.dsail.vip/), South China University of Technology.

My current research interest focuses on **Trustworthy Machine Learning**, particularly on **Backdoor Learning**. I'm interested in security issues across all domains of AI, including Computer Vision, Audio & Signal Processing and Large Language Models. 

# üî•News

- [2025.02] Our latest work [BackdoorDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11798) on Diffusion Backdoor has been released on ArXiv. Our code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/linweiii/BackdoorDM).
- [2024.12] My first acdemic paper on audio backdoor defense was accepted by [ICASSP 2025](https://2025.ieeeicassp.org/). Thanks to the support of my co-authors and Prof. Liu!
- [2024.12] I completed my Software Development Intern at ZTE Corporation. Thanks to all my mentors and co-workers!
- [2024.09] I joined the Data Mangement Group at ZTE Corporation as a Software Development Engineer, focusing on AI for Data.
